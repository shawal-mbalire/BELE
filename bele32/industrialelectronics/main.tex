    \section{Introduction}
    The class focuses on pwer conversion for a systems
    Converters can be clasified as
    \begin{itemize}
        \item ac-ac 
        \item ac-dc 
        \item dc-ac 
        \item dc-dc 
    \end{itemize}
    \subsection{Exmples and applications}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Fan regulator
        \item Light dimmer
        \item Motor speed controller
        \item Inverters
        \item Solar power systems
        \item Power supply systems
    \end{enumerate}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Electrical motion caused about by motors and control
        \item Electric temperature change(heating,cooling, welding) and control
        \item Induction
    \end{itemize}

    \section{Power Efficiency}
    I deal case has a power Efficiency of one such as inverers and rectifiers

    powerlosses = heat = cooling = costs

    \textbf{Comparisoons between ICEs and EVs}

    if you're comparing look for relatively similar components eg bajaj to zembo

    Cost is relative of the applications

    \section{Componentts}
    ideally lossless components. Periodic signals. Here we look at average power in a period equal to zero

    \textbf{Componetns}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Capacitors
        \item Ideal inductor/ transformer
        \item Electronic component(diodes, transistors, thyristors)
        \item for BJTs either in cutoff or in saturation (switching mode)
        \item Avoid resistance as resistors are lossy
    \end{enumerate}
    switcing mode power supplys (SMPS)
    even stepping up and down we would love to avoid resistors

    \section{switching}

    \subsection{ideal switch characteristics}
     on state, ideal switch has zero voltage and non zero current

     Capable of carrying infinite current

     off state has non zero voltage and zero current accross

     it must be able to block an infinite voltage


     \textbf{Why is it beter to have a robot}

     mechanical switches, bouncing

     electromagnetic switches(em relays in cars)

     electronic switches(diodes,transistors, mosfets) temperature bound, leakage current

     compare the different types of switches
     rectifiers would require 50Hz switching

     \textbf{Single phase or three phase\\
     teslaa charge, mail mill} three phase best for power Efficiency in machines thus if you need a 3 phase machine you can wire up 3phase.
     Expense, custom components
     Factory rates. Cheap to buy , cheap to operate


     ideal vs ral world

     how is 3 phase power if some phases aren't used

    \subsection{Real switch characteristics}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item On state 
    \end{enumerate}

    \subsection{switch control}
    brick wall is an ideal filter

    uncontrolled switch (diode)

    fully controlled switch (3 legged)

    semi controlled- turn on with trminal but can't swithc off with terminal

    FET is voltage controlled, BJT is current controlled

    \section{device physics}

    \subsection{p-n junction}
    junction
    forward bias on switch,conductor
    reverse bias off switch,insulator

    power diode
    the juction might be doped with p+,n-,n+ so as to reduce the available electrons thus increasing the insulation properties for the diode to switch. 
    This gives a non even depletion region
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Physically larger
        \item vrtical configuration
    \end{enumerate}
    Useful for rectification. We can have a break down voltage of about 2kV
    IV characteristic graph

    Some rectification circuits are applied after a step down transformer as dc devices are usually of low power

    Welding macines?
    \subsubsection*{Homework}
    D52P2400s diode 

    Junction capacitance 

    DIfferences between power diodes and normal diodes, transient xtics, reverse recovery tie
     
    Switching losses

    \subsection{Bi Polar Juction transistors Q}
